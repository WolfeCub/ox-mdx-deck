* Mdx Deck Org Exporter
  This Emacs package exports [[https://orgmode.org/][Org-mode documents]] to [[https://github.com/jxnblk/mdx-deck][mdx-deck]] using the
  [[https://github.com/russross/blackfriday][blackfriday markdown exporter]]. Any code blocks marked =rjsx=
  will be copied verbatim into the output document. This allows you
  to write react that will be compiled by =mdx-deck=.
